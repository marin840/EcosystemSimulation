Simulating an ecosystem
Abstract
This paper describes simulation of an ecosystem made within cross-platform game engine Unity. Existing simulators are described at the beginning: mobile game Evolution, computer game Species ALRE and Framsticks simulator.
After that, in practical part, generation of the environment which animals will inhabit is described first. Two types of animals are implemented, rabbits and foxes, as well as generation of plants which present the food for the rabbits. Behavior of the animals is implemented using the State design pattern. Results of the simulation are presented using graphs. Connection between size of the populations and time is shown, as well as change in average amount of parameters: speed, sense and size.  
Key words: simulation, ecosystem, simulator, predator, prey, behavior, decisions, state, population, genetic algorithm
