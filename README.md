# Simulating an Ecosystem

[`Thesis Report`](https://repozitorij.fer.unizg.hr/en/islandora/object/fer:9528)

This thesis describes the simulation of an ecosystem created within the cross-platform game engine Unity. Existing simulators are discussed at the beginning: the mobile game Evolution, the computer game Species ALRE, and the Framsticks simulator. Following that, in the practical section, the generation of the environment in which animals will inhabit is described first. Two types of animals are implemented: rabbits and foxes, along with the generation of plants which serve as food for the rabbits. The behavior of the animals is implemented using the State design pattern. Results of the simulation are presented using graphs, showing the connection between the size of populations and time, as well as changes in the average values of parameters such as speed, sense, and size.
